Author: Wei Shi, Yang Liao and Gordon K Smyth with contributions from Jenny Dai
Maintainer: Wei Shi <wei.shi@onjcri.org.au>, Yang Liao <yang.liao@onjcri.org.au> and Gordon K Smyth <smyth@wehi.edu.au>
Description: Alignment, quantification and analysis of
        RNA sequencing data (including both bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq) and
        DNA sequenicng data (including ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, WGS, WES etc). 
        Includes functionality for read mapping, read counting, SNP calling, 
        structural variant detection and gene fusion discovery. Can be applied
        to all major sequencing techologies and to both short and long
        sequence reads.
