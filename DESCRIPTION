Description: This R package provides facilities for processing the read data generated by the next-gen sequencing technologies. These facilities include quality assessment, read alignment, read summarization, exon-exon junction detection, absolute expression calling and SNP discovery. This package can be used to process both short and long reads. It supports major sequencing platforms such as Illumina GA/HiSeq, Roche 454, ABI SOLiD and Ion Torrent.
