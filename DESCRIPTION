Description: This R package provides powerful and easy-to-use tools for
        analyzing next-gen sequencing read data. Functions of this
        package include quality assessment of sequence reads, read
        alignment, read summarization, exon-exon junction detection,
        fusion detection, detection of short and long indels, absolute
        expression calling and SNP calling. This package can be used to
        anlayze data generated from all major sequencing platforms such
        as Illumina GA/HiSeq/MiSeq, Roche GS-FLX, ABI SOLiD and
        LifeTech Ion PGM/Proton sequencers. It supports multiple
        operating systems incluidng Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and
        Solaris.
