Description: Rsubread is a toolbox developed for the analyses of
        second and third generation sequencing data. It can be used
        for read mapping, read counting, SNP calling, structural
        variant detection and gene fusion discovery. It can be applied
        to all major sequencing techologies and is suitable for the
        analysis of both short and long reads.
