Title:  Rsubread: a super fast, sensitive and accurate read aligner for mapping next-generation sequencing reads 
Version: 1.6.2
Author: Wei Shi, Yang Liao and Jenny Zhiyin Dai
Maintainer: Wei Shi <shi@wehi.edu.au>
Description: This package performs read mapping, exon junction detection and other tasks for next-generation sequencing data. The read mapping function implements a novel mapping paradigm, which is entirely different from the "seed-and-extent" paradigm. It can be used to map both short reads and long reads (>200bp) and reads of variable lengths. It also provides functions to summarize read counts to genes or exons and gives detection p values for each gene in the RNA-seq data.
