Description: Provides powerful and easy-to-use tools for
        analyzing next-gen sequencing read data.
        Includes quality assessment of sequence reads, read
        alignment, read summarization, exon-exon junction detection,
        fusion detection, detection of short and long indels, absolute
        expression calling and SNP calling. Can be used with reads
        generated from any of the major sequencing platforms including
        Illumina GA/HiSeq/MiSeq, Roche GS-FLX, ABI SOLiD and
        LifeTech Ion PGM/Proton sequencers.
