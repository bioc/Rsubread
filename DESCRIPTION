Description: Alignment, quantification and analysis of
        second and third generation sequencing data. Includes functionality
        for read mapping, read counting, SNP calling, structural
        variant detection and gene fusion discovery. Can be applied
        to all major sequencing techologies and to both short and long
        sequence reads.
