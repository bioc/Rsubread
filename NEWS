CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Fine-tuning of read alignment function (align) and exon-exon junction detection function (subjunc).

    o Major update to SNP calling algorithm (now use Fisher' exact tests to call SNPs).

    o More efficient implementation for removing duplicated reads (eg. supporting multi-threads and using less memory).



CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Significant improvement on the exon-exon junction detection (subjunc function). 

    o Calling SNPs using a simple allele fraction approach (callSNPs function) . 

    o Removing duplicated reads (removeDupReads function).
